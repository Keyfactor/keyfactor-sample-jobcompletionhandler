# Keyfactor Command Sample Job Completion Handler

## Overview

The Keyfactor Command platform has an extension point that allows custom code to be executed after the completion
of orchestrator jobs.
This code is in the form of a .NET assembly that is installed on the Command server. 
The extension receives basic information about the job (orchestrator that executed the job, job type, job identification,
success or failure, etc.) and can perform whatever server-side job post-processing is desired.

Typical use cases would be triggering external business workflow systems on success or failure of orchestrator jobs.

This repository contains a sample job completion handler that traces out the job context information provided and
demonstrates making an API call back into the Command platform.

Job Completion Handlers were introduced in Command version 9.0. This sample has been tested with Command Version 11.2.
The way Completion Handlers and other extensions are loaded in Command changed in version 11.
Please review the comments and examples in this repository in order to configure and load the Completion Handler correctly.


## Getting Started

To use this sample you will need:
- An understanding of the Keyfactor Command platform, orchestrators, orchestrator extensions, certificate stores, and certificate store related jobs
- An understanding of C# and .NET development
- A working Keyfactor Command instance and administrative access to the server it is running on
- An installed, configured, and approved Universal Orchestrator Framework instance
- The "Windows Certificate" Universal Orchestrator Extension, installed into the Orchestrator Framework
- The corresponding "WinCert" certificate store type configured on the Command instance
- An instance of a "WinCert" certificate store with a scheduled inventory job
- Visual Studio (or other development environment that can build a .NET C# assembly)

#### 1 - Get a Command environment up and running with an inventory job running on a certificate store

Job completion handlers execute after an orchestrator job completes, so to play with completion handlers, you will need a
job running on some orchestrator. Completion handlers are typically written to be specific to a job type and in the case
of certificate store jobs, also specific to a certificate store type.
This sample is specific to the "WinCert" certificate store type, which is used to manage certificates found in Local
Machine certificate stores on Windows Servers. If you don't already have the WinCert extension installed in your orchestrator, it
can be found at https://github.com/Keyfactor/iis-orchestrator. Any certificate store type may be used, but adjustments
to the sample will be necessary if it isn't "WinCert"

The details of getting your Command environment with a certificate store set up are beyond the scope of this documentation. 

#### 2 - Determine the Certificate Store Type Job IDs in your Command environment

Every job that can be sent to an Orchestrator has a "Job Type" that is identified by a GUID.
When a certificate store type is configured in Command, the corresponding job types related to that certificate store type
are dynamically created.
These job type GUIDs are unique to each Command instance.

When a completion handler is registered in the Command system, the registration includes a list of the job type GUIDs 
that the handler will handle.
Whenever a job completes, the Command platform checks to see if there are any job completion handlers registered to handle
that job type, and if so the handler is called.

Since this sample is specific to the WinCert store type, the specific WinCert related job GUIDs must be determined for 
your environment.

To retrieve the GUIDs, the `GET /CertificateStoreTypes/Name/` API endpoint may be used.

Using the Keyfactor API Reference and Utility, scroll down to the *CertificateStoreType* API, and select the
GET /CertificateStoreTypes/Name/{name} end point.
Enter "WinCert" the name parameter and click the `Try it out!` button to execute the API.

Alternatively, you could use a curl command similar to the following (after substituting your credentials and specifying 
the proper URL for your Command Server API endpoint:

`curl -u {domain}\\{account}:{password}  'https://{commandserver}/KeyfactorAPI/CertificateStoreTypes/Name/WinCert'`

Once the response is returned, scroll down to the end of the JSON result.
You will see a list of Job Types and their associated GUIDs which will look something like:

```
    "InventoryJobType": "49b3a17d-cada-4ec8-84c6-7719bf5beef3",
    "ManagementJobType": "4be14534-55b0-4cd7-9871-536b55b5e973",
    "EnrollmentJobType": "e868b3f8-9b6a-48b1-91c8-683d71d94f61"
```

Note that if you pick a different cert store type, you may see different job types as not all cert store types implement 
all of the possible job types. The WinCert store implements the above three job types. Your GUIDs will be different.

#### 3 - Build the sample extension

Add Keyfactor's GitHub NuGet package repository to your list of Visual Studio NuGet package sources.
The URL for the package source is `https://nuget.pkg.github.com/Keyfactor/index.json`.
You will need to create a GitHub personal access token and use it to authenticate to the GitHub package source.
The package repository is public read but does require a GitHub login. 

Use Visual Studio to build the solution file in this repository.

Note that this extension will need to be compiled with the same version of the .NET Framework as is the Command 
instance it will be plugged into. This project targets both .NET 6.0 and .NET 8.0. The appropriate output can be selected for the Command version in use.
Future versions of Command are planed to be targeted for current versions of .NET. 
If this sample or production Completion Handlers are built against future versions, the target framework may need to be updated.

#### 4 - Copy the assembly to the Command Server

Copy the compiled assembly (`SampleJobCompletionHandler.dll`), `manifest.json` and required dependencies to the correct location
for Extensions for the Orchestrator API endpoint on the Command Server. You may organize these under a single sub-directory.
This is typically `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebAgentServices\Extensions\JobCompleteHandlers`

In cases where your custom code may need additional dependent assemblies, make sure to only copy assemblies that are specific to your handler. 
As long as Extensions are copied into an isolated folder, there is no concern of overwriting libraries. Different versions of a library can be 
used as long as they are included correctly in the Extensions folder in use.

#### 5 - Register the handler on the Command Server

Job completion handlers are loaded by the extension loader system using the `manifest.json` file.

A sample `manifest.json` file for this extension is included in this repository. It should be edited with the correct Options values.
The correct job type GUIDs retrieved above should be entered in a comma-seperated list in the JobTypes property.

Multiple completion handlers may be registered. If they are located in the same sub-directory for Extension loading,
the `manifest.json` file needs to specify __all__ extensions in a directory to load. If you do not wish to merge `manifest.json`
files, organize extensions into seperate sub-directories entirely.

Note that an incorrect `manifest.json` file or a `manifest.json` that points to an assembly that cannot be loaded can prevent
the Orchestrator API from operating and prevent all Orchestrators from contacting the platform. Be sure the check the
logs (see below) for proper operation any time the `manifest.json` or the corresponding Assemblies are changed.

#### 6 - Enable trace logging for the handler

To be able to see the trace log messages in the sample without having to enable trace level logging for the whole 
Orchestrator API endpoint, find the NLog configuration file for the Orchestrator API endpoint, usually located at:

`C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Platform\WebAgentServices\NLog_Orchestrators.config`

and add the following rule inside the `<Rules>` section:

`<logger name="*.SampleJobCompletionHandler" minlevel="Trace" writeTo="logfile" final="true"/>`

just before the default logging rule:

 `<logger name="*" minlevel="Info" writeTo="logfile" />`

#### 7 - Restart IIS

Changes to extensions and a `manifest.json` will require that the web server is restarted, which can be done by running the iisreset command.

At this point trace messages should appear in the Orchestrator API endpoint logs whenever a WinCert store type job
is completed by an orchestrator. By default the logs will be at `C:\Keyfactor\logs\Command_OrchestratorsAPI_Log.txt`

# Understanding the Sample

Examine the sample code for a detailed understanding of how the handler works, but a higher level overview is described here.

#### Orchestrator Job Flow

For background information, orchestrator jobs are processed by Command as follows:

- A job is scheduled on the Command platform (and targeted at a specific Orchestrator).
- Orchestrators periodically check in with the Command platform to see if there is any work requested. When they check in they receive a list of jobs and requested times to run those jobs.
- When the orchestrator thinks it's time to do a job that it was asked to do, it asks the Command platform for the job details.
- The Command platform provides the job details and the Orchestrator executes the job.
- The Orchestrator returns the results of the job and the completion status to the Command platform.
- The Command platform stores any job related data (such as inventory results) and then records the completion status of the job.
- The Command platform looks for any registered job completion handlers that match the job type and executes them.
- (We are here)

While this sample discusses jobs that are related to certificate store management, there are other kinds of jobs that
ship with the platform and it is possible to create custom jobs. The same job flow works for all job types,
including the completion handler step.

#### RunHandler method

The Completion Handler is a .NET class that implements the `IOrchestratorJobCompleteHandler` interface.
The interface contains a single method with a signature of `bool RunHandler(OrchestratorJobCompleteHandlerContext context)`.
The handler's responsibility is to look at the context object (see below),
do whatever processing is necessary, and return a true or false success status.
Since a single completion handler will typically manage multiple job types, the RunHandler method will usually have some
sort of dispatch logic to figure out what kind of job has completed and call the appropriate logic for the job.

Looking at the sample code, you will see an implementation of the RunHandler method, which relays control to an async
version of the method, which in turn determines the job type and calls a job specific method.

The method that handles inventory jobs demonstrates using data from the context object to make an API call back to the 
Command platform to retrieve more information about the inventory job (in this case the history of previous job runs).
Since the API call is an asynchronous call, the code shows how to transition from the synchronous RunHander interface.

The method that handles management jobs demonstrates having a different code path based on the various operation types
can occur with management jobs.

Finally, the method that handles reenrollment jobs doesn't have any logic but shows handling the third kind of job that
is possible with the WinCert store type.

All of the methods trace out control of flow and it should be clear as to where you could put your own logic.
See below for sample trace output.

The interface assemblies needed by the code are shipped with the Command platform and for developers are made publicly 
available as NuGet packages on GitHub's package server (in the Keyfactor Organization). The sample uses the following
Keyfactor specific packages: 
- `Keyfactor.Logging`
- `Keyfactor.Orchestrators.Common`
- `Keyfactor.Platform.IOrchestratorJobCompleteHandler`

#### Context Object

When the completion handler is executed, it is passed a context object that contains information about the job that just completed.
Depending on the job type, various fields in the context object may or may not be present. The sample code traces out the
contents of the context object.

# Summary
This document has provided an example Job Completion Handler for a specific job type and can be extended to handle other job types.
Information was provided for using the Keyfactor APIs to find the correct GUIDs to process specific job types.
The sample also provides examples for handling Inventory, Management and Reenrollment jobs, along with how to access the context properties and a working HTTP Client.
Once the handler has been developed, instructions were provided describing how to load the handler with a `manifest.json` file so Keyfactor Command can call the appropriate handler.
For additional information, please refer to the comments in the example source code.
